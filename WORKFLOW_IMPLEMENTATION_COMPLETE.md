## 🎯 Branch Strategy

### Main Branch (Production)
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code that auto-deploys
- **Contains:** Only essential files needed to run the application
- **Excludes:** Tests, documentation, IDE configs, dev scripts
- **Protected:** Force push disabled, requires approvals
- **Auto-deploys:** On every push via GitHub Actions

### Developer Branch (Development)  
- **Purpose:** Complete development environment
- **Contains:** All files including tests, docs, dev tools
- **Workflow:** Day-to-day development happens here
- **Flexible:** More permissive rules for rapid development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First-Time Setup (Do Once)

```powershell
# 1. Create developer branch
git checkout -b developer
git push -u origin developer

# 2. Apply production gitignore to main
git checkout main
Copy-Item .gitignore.production .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: apply production gitignore"

# 3. Configure GitHub secrets (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

# 4. Set up branch protection rules (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
```

### Daily Development Workflow

```powershell
# Work on developer branch
git checkout developer
git pull origin developer

# Make changes, test, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin developer
```

### Deploy to Production

**Option 1: Automated (Recommended)**
```powershell
# PowerShell
.\deploy-to-production.ps1

# Or Git Bash
bash deploy-to-production.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual**
```powershell
git checkout main
git merge developer --no-ff -m "Release: deployment description"
git push origin main  # Triggers GitHub Actions
git checkout developer
git merge main
git push origin developer
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### GitHub Secrets Required

The following secrets need to be added to GitHub for auto-deployment:

- `PRODUCTION_HOST` - Server IP or domain
- `PRODUCTION_USER` - SSH username
- `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY` - Private SSH key
- `PRODUCTION_PORT` - SSH port (usually 22)
- `PRODUCTION_PATH` - Project path on server
- `PRODUCTION_URL` - Website URL
- `DB_USERNAME` - Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `DB_DATABASE` - Database name
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - (Optional) Slack notifications

### Files Excluded from Production

The following are **excluded** from the main branch:
- ❌ All `.md` files (except README.md)
- ❌ `/tests/` directory
- ❌ `phpunit.xml`
- ❌ IDE configurations (`.vscode`, `.idea`)
- ❌ Database seeders
- ❌ Development scripts
- ❌ Git files

### Files Included in Production

Only these files are **included** in the main branch:
- ✅ Application code (`app/`, `config/`, `routes/`)
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Frontend resources (`resources/`)
- ✅ Public assets (`public/`)
- ✅ Configuration files (`composer.json`, `package.json`)
- ✅ Essential configs (`.env.example`, `artisan`)

## 🎯 Benefits of This Workflow

**Solution:** Fix tests or temporarily skip them (not recommended for production)

### Issue: Merge conflicts
**Solution:** Resolve conflicts manually, then continue with deployment

### Issue: Production site not updating
**Solution:** Check GitHub Actions, verify deployment completed, clear server caches
