## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Web UI
Visit: https://github.com/techapsalwar/avhira/actions
- Click on the latest workflow run
- Watch real-time logs
- Green checkmarks = success
- Red X = error (check logs)

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh run watch
```

---

## ✅ When Deployment Completes

You'll see "✅ All checks have passed" on GitHub Actions.

### Immediate Next Steps:

#### Step 1: SKIP - Document Root Already Configured! ✅

**Good News!** The deployment workflow now handles the two-directory structure automatically:
- Laravel application: `/home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/avhira/`
- Web root (document root): `/home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/public_html/`

**No manual document root changes needed!** The workflow automatically:
- Deploys Laravel to `/avhira/`
- Copies build assets to `/public_html/build/`
- Creates correct `index.php` in `/public_html/`
- Sets up all necessary symlinks

---

#### Step 2: Run Post-Deployment Commands (Optional - Already Done by Workflow!)

The workflow automatically runs all necessary commands. You only need to SSH in if you want to verify or troubleshoot:

```powershell
# Connect to Hostinger
ssh -i "$HOME\.ssh\avhira_deploy_rsa" -p 65002 u885878505@89.117.188.174

# Navigate to Laravel application
cd /home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/avhira

# Check application status
php artisan about

# Exit SSH
exit
```

**Note:** The workflow already handles:
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Storage symlinks
- ✅ Cache optimization
- ✅ Build asset deployment

---

#### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Visit your website**: https://avhira.com

2. **Check these items**:
   - [ ] Homepage loads without errors
   - [ ] Images display correctly
   - [ ] CSS styles are applied
   - [ ] JavaScript works (interactive elements)
   - [ ] Navigation menu works
   - [ ] Product pages load
   - [ ] Cart functionality works
   - [ ] No 500 errors

3. **Test key features**:
   - [ ] User registration
   - [ ] User login
   - [ ] Browse products
   - [ ] Add to cart
   - [ ] Checkout page loads

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: Deployment fails in GitHub Actions

**Check**:
1. Click on failed step in GitHub Actions
2. Read error message
3. Common causes:
   - SSH connection issue (check secrets)
   - Permission denied (verify SSH key)
   - Build error (check package.json/composer.json)

**Fix**:
- Verify all 5 GitHub Secrets are correct
- Test SSH manually: `ssh -i "$HOME\.ssh\avhira_deploy" -p 65002 u885878505@89.117.188.174`
- Fix code issue and push again

---

### Issue: Site shows "500 Internal Server Error"

**SSH and run**:
```bash
cd /home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/public_html

# Check logs
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Fix permissions
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache

# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Recache
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

---

### Issue: Assets not loading (CSS/JS 404 errors)

**Causes**:
1. Document root not set to `/public` folder
2. Assets not built properly
3. Cache issues

**Fix**:
1. Set document root in Hostinger (see Step 1 above)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
4. SSH and run: `php artisan storage:link`

---

### Issue: Database connection error

**Check**:
```bash
ssh -i "$HOME\.ssh\avhira_deploy" -p 65002 u885878505@89.117.188.174
cd /home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/public_html

# Verify .env file
cat .env | grep DB_

# Should show:
# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_DATABASE=u885878505_avhira
# DB_USERNAME=u885878505_avhira
# DB_PASSWORD=Krishan1!avhira
```

**Fix if wrong**:
```bash
nano .env
# Update database credentials
# Save: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter

php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

---

### Issue: Site shows maintenance mode (503)

**Fix**:
```bash
ssh -i "$HOME\.ssh\avhira_deploy" -p 65002 u885878505@89.117.188.174
cd /home/u885878505/domains/avhira.com/public_html

# Disable maintenance mode
php artisan up

# Remove maintenance file
rm -f storage/framework/down
```
