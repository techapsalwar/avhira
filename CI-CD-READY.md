## 🚀 What Happens When You Push Code

```
1. You push code to GitHub
   ↓
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggered
   ↓
3. Builds your Laravel application
   - Installs PHP dependencies
   - Compiles CSS/JS with Vite
   - Creates optimized package
   ↓
4. Uploads to Hostinger securely
   ↓
5. Deploys with ZERO downtime
   - Creates new release
   - Links shared files (.env, storage)
   - Switches symlink atomically
   ↓
6. Optimizes Laravel
   - Caches config, routes, views
   - Runs database migrations
   ↓
7. ✅ Your website is live!

⏱️ Total Time: 2-3 minutes
🔴 Downtime: 0 seconds
```

## 📋 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

**Run the setup script:**

```powershell
# Open PowerShell in project directory
cd e:\Avhira\avhirawebsite\avhira

# Run setup script
.\setup-github.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Initializes git repository
- ✅ Connects to GitHub (techapsalwar/avhira)
- ✅ Adds all files
- ✅ Creates commit
- ✅ Pushes to main branch

**You'll need:**
- GitHub Personal Access Token (not password!)
- Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Scopes: `repo`, `workflow`

---

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)

Go to: [https://github.com/techapsalwar/avhira/settings/secrets/actions](https://github.com/techapsalwar/avhira/settings/secrets/actions)

Click **"New repository secret"** and add each:

| Secret Name | Value to Enter |
|------------|----------------|
| `SSH_HOST` | `89.117.188.174` |
| `SSH_USERNAME` | `u885878505` |
| `SSH_PASSWORD` | Your Hostinger password |
| `SSH_PORT` | `65002` |
| `PROJECT_PATH` | `/home/u885878505/public_html/avhira` |

**⚠️ Important:** Enter values exactly, no extra spaces!

---

### Step 3: Prepare Hostinger Server (5 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh -p 65002 u885878505@89.117.188.174

# Create project structure
cd ~/public_html
mkdir -p avhira/{releases,shared/{storage/{app,framework,logs},bootstrap/cache}}
cd avhira
mkdir -p shared/storage/framework/{cache,sessions,views}
mkdir -p shared/storage/app/{public,private}

# Create .env file
nano shared/.env
```

**Paste this in .env** (update YOUR_APP_KEY and database credentials):

```env
APP_NAME=Avhira
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=error

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=u885878505_avhira
DB_USERNAME=u885878505_avhira
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=avhirahouse@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=cdcizijafuamshib
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=avhirahouse@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Avhira"

RAZORPAY_KEY=rzp_live_RPrwNi6UTxcxc7
RAZORPAY_SECRET=FpDwSo2FUmWhB72yydyLaLJR
```

**Save:** `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`

---

### Step 4: Set Up Database (3 minutes)

1. **Login to Hostinger hPanel**
2. Go to **Databases** → **MySQL Databases**
3. **Create Database:**
   - Name: `u885878505_avhira`
4. **Create User:**
   - Username: `u885878505_avhira`
   - Password: (strong password)
5. **Grant Privileges:**
   - Add user to database with ALL PRIVILEGES
6. **Update .env** on server with credentials

---

### Step 5: Configure Document Root (2 minutes)

**In Hostinger hPanel:**

1. Go to **Domains**
2. Select your domain
3. Click **Manage**
4. Set Document Root to:
   ```
   /home/u885878505/public_html/avhira/current/public
   ```

---

### Step 6: Deploy! 🚀

Once Steps 1-5 are complete:

**Option A: Automatic (Push triggers deployment)**
```bash
# Your setup script already pushed the code
# Check GitHub Actions to see it deploying!
```

**Option B: Manual trigger**
1. Go to: https://github.com/techapsalwar/avhira/actions
2. Click "Deploy to Hostinger"
3. Click "Run workflow"

---

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment

cd ~/public_html/avhira
ls -la current  # Should be symlink to release
ls -la releases/  # Should show timestamp directory
```
