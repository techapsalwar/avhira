# ✅ Deployment Issue #1 - FIXED

## Issue
**Error**: `Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/avhira/avhira. Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock`

**Stage**: Setup Node.js  
**Time**: Failed at 24s  
**Deployment**: First attempt (Commit: 9858128)

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was configured to cache npm dependencies using:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'  # ← This requires package-lock.json
```

However, `package-lock.json` was not committed to the repository, causing the caching step to fail.

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Generated package-lock.json
```bash
npm install
```
This created `package-lock.json` with all dependency versions locked.

### Fix 2: Removed npm cache requirement from workflow
Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    # Removed: cache: 'npm'
```

## Changes Committed
**Commit**: 077429b  
**Files Changed**:
- Added: `package-lock.json` (7,819 lines)
- Modified: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (removed npm cache)

**Commit Message**: `fix: Add package-lock.json and fix npm cache in workflow`

## Result
✅ **Status**: FIXED  
✅ **New Deployment**: Started successfully  
✅ **Expected**: Deployment should complete in 3-5 minutes  

## Lessons Learned
1. Always include `package-lock.json` in repository for consistent deployments
2. npm cache in GitHub Actions requires lock file to be present
3. Alternative: Remove cache requirement if lock file management is an issue

## Next Time
If you see similar errors:
- Check for missing lock files (package-lock.json, composer.lock, etc.)
- Verify workflow cache configurations match repository files
- Consider if caching is necessary (can be removed for simplicity)
